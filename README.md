# Setup
1. To run these programs, you must have Python installed. To download Python go to [this website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest release. Then, run the installer and restart your computer for its changes to take effect.
2. Its reccomended you intall git, so that you can pull down updates to the project and script(s) easily. To do so, go to [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and get the relevent version, and run the installer.
3. If you do not have an IDE, you must download one. I reccomend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for an op builders needs.
4. Open Visual Studio Code, if it isnt already open, and hit Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command pallete. Type "clone" and click on the command "Git: Clone". then enter this link "https://github.com/Napkino/AtomicBuilder.git" and hit enter. If that link does not work, you have to get a new link to clone the repository from. Look that up, cause that shouldnt happen and i dont feel like writting about it anymore.
